This is a game written for GameBoyAdvance.

The player uses 4 arrow keys to move the trash can.

The goal is to use the trash can to collect as many pieces of garbage as possible while avoid touching valuable items.

If the player have carelessly touched 3 valuable items, the game will end immediately and show the player's score.

Note that there is a mysterious figure who can help you with your garbage collection...

The player may use the SELECT key to return to the title page at any time.
